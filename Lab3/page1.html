<h1>I Love Gym !</h1>    
<p>
Like most people I started the gym to get the desired "abs". However as time went by and the more research I did, I became more and more dedicated
as the results started to show. Now it has became part of my lifestyle and helps me in so many ways - mentally and confidence wise, as well as keeping me in
routine ! It also made me more concious of the food I eat as it helps me eat more whole foods :)
