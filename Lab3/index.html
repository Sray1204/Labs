<h1>First Year</h1>
<h2>Adjustment</h2>
<p>My first time attending Edinburgh Napier University as a fresh High School Student was nerve wracking. Being completely by myself in a new
    environemnt was jarring, but the casual but professional environemnt at napier made me feel more at ease and throughout the weeks I found
    myself fitting in and finding friends like myself who love all things nerdy and computers !
</p>
<aside>Since then I have never felt a more truer version of myself!</aside>
